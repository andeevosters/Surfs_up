# Surfs_up
## Overview of the analysis: 
We are exploring the feasibility opening a surf & shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii, and we want to look at weather data to determine if the weather is suitable for a new venture like this. We are specifically looking at June and December temperatures, which will give us a suitable lens into sustainability year-round.

## Results: 
In looking at the temperatures recorded in our dataset for the months of June and December, we observed the following:
* In June, the temperature hangs generally between 73 and 77 degrees, with an average of 74 degrees. 
* In December, the temperature are just slightly lowers, with a general range of 69 to 74 degrees, with an average of 71 degrees.
* There is a slightly higher standard of deviation with the December temperatures, implying there are more days with temperatures that fall outside of the norm.
* There is only a 2-degree difference of max temps recorded (June at 85, December at 83), yet an 8-degree difference in minimum temps (June at 64, December at 56). 
* The number of temperature recordings for June and December are 1,700 and 1,517 respectively, enough data points to gauge statistics confidently.
There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December. Use images as support where needed.(6 pt)
