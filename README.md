# Surfs_up
## Overview of the analysis: 
We are exploring the feasibility opening a surf & shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii, and we want to look at weather data to determine if the weather is suitable for a new venture like this. We are specifically looking at June and December temperatures, which will give us a suitable lens into sustainability year-round.

## Results: 
In looking at the temperatures recorded in our dataset for the months of June and December, we observed the following:
* In June, the temperature hangs generally between 73 and 77 degrees, with an average of 74 degrees.

* In December, the temperature are just slightly lowers, with a general range of 69 to 74 degrees, with an average of 71 degrees.

* There is a slightly higher standard of deviation with the December temperatures, implying there are more days with temperatures that fall outside of the norm.
* There is only a 2-degree difference of max temps recorded (June at 85, December at 83), yet an 8-degree difference in minimum temps (June at 64, December at 56). 
* The number of temperature recordings for June and December are 1,700 and 1,517 respectively, enough data points to gauge statistics confidently.

## Summary:
Given the data, we wouldn't hesitate to recommend a surf and shake shop as an investment in Oahu. We also looked at precipitation for those two months, and while there are some outliers that imply heavier rain at times, the precipitation is generally minimal and wouldn't pose a problem. Lastly, we'd recommend looking at data on tourism/travel to round out the data needed to ensure confidence in investing.
